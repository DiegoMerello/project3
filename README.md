<p align="center"/p>![Ironhack logo](https://i.imgur.com/1QgrNNw.png)



## Project Description
The third project of the Data Analytics Part Time Bootcamp consists to predict diamond price based on its characteristics. Such as weight, color or cut.
The competition is held in Kaggle. The students can visit the leaderboard and its relative position among all the participants.



## Built with

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Import libraries: Pandas; matplotlib; from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
- [ ] Clean the data, removing price outliers by carat, depth and table
- [ ] Test your code
